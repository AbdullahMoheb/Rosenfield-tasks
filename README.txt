Project Overview

This project includes manual testing, automation testing, JMeter performance testing, and database tasks. Each section contains files relevant to the respective testing tasks.

1. Manual Testing Task
This section contains all the test cases and bug reports related to "Set DataSource" & "StatCalc."

Test Case.xlsx - Contains all test cases for "Set DataSource" & "StatCalc."
Test Scenario.xlsx - Contains test scenarios used for these test cases.
Bug File:
	Bug.xlsx - Contains a detailed bug report.
	PNG Files - Screenshots of reported bugs.

2. Automation Task
This section contains automation scripts for Sign-in and Playlist functionalities.

Sign_up.java - Sign-up separetly from the rest of the classes ( no specific reason for this, I thought to run it alone )
Main.java - Should be run as a Java application. It handles:
User Sign-in
Playlist operations (Adding songs and playing the playlist)
AddToPlaylist.java - Specifically handles adding songs to a playlist and playing the playlist.

How to Run:
Ensure Java is installed.
Run Main.java as a Java Application.

3. JMeter Task
This section contains JMeter test scripts for performance testing.

What to play.jmx - Load testing script that performs 1000 searches on Spotify.
Run Playlist.jmx - Runs a playlist 1000 times within 5 seconds.

How to Run:
Open JMeter.
Load the respective .jmx file.
Start the test.

4. Database Task
This section contains database-related testing.

Database.txt - Contains database-related tasks and queries.

Notes

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running automation or JMeter tasks.

Bug reports are available in both .xlsx format and PNG images for better visualization.

Java automation tasks require a working Java environment.

JMeter tasks require Apache JMeter installed.
